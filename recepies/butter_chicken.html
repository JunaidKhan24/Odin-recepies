    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>chicken</li>
        <li>rice</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>tomato, 2</li>
        <li>oil, 3 tablespoon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, mix your yogurt marinade together.</li>
        <li>Marinate chicken for 20 minutes, or overnight if time allows. (The longer it marinates, the more tender your chicken will be.)</li>
        <li>Sear chicken in a skillet or pan. Keep those charred bits on the pan to make your sauce. Browned bits = flavour. If you have too many burnt pieces stuck to the pan, you can discard some of them if you wish</li>
        <li>Finally, make your curry sauce in the same skillet.</li>
    </ol>
